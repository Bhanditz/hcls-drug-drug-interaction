        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Ensuring medication therapy occurs safely and to the maximum benefit for of any given patients is of great
            interest to clinicians (Institute of Medicine 2007). One possible threat to patient safety comes from exposure
            to two or more drugs that are known to interact (i.e., potential drug-drug interactions or PDDIs), and could therefore
            lead to a clinically observable effect on the patient (i.e., an actual drug-drug interaction). While the effects
            that may occur due to exposure to some PDDIs can benefit patients (e.g., some HIV therapies use a low-dose of ritonavir
            to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered protease inhibitors by inhibiting their metabolism), PDDIs are
            more often a patient safety concern. Clinically important events that are attributable to PDDI exposure occur in
            5.3%— - 14.3% of inpatients, and are responsible for up to 231,000 emergency department visits that occur each year in
            the United States alone (Magro et al. 2012; CDC 2012). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies conducted
            on 3 continents found the median rate of PDDI associated hospital admissions to be 22.2%
            (interquartile range 16.6— - 36.0%)(Dechanont et al. 2014). The broad concern about harm from PDDIs is reflected in
            the fact that, in the United States, PDDI alerting is a criteria included in the so-called Meaningful Use criteria
            for Electronic Health Records (CMS 2013; Ridgley et al. 2012), and population-based strategies for tracking exposure
            are promoted by organizations such as the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (National Quality Measures Clearinghouse 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Clinicians often face barriers to the effective and appropriate management of PDDI exposures (Nabovati et al. 2017).
            Barriers include incomplete personal PDDI knowledge and PDDI alerts with poor specificity (Abarca et al. 2004;
            Van der Sijs et al. 2006). An awareness of the need for PDDI decision support prompts clinicians to use various drug
            knowledge resources including print or online drug information references, drug interaction checking tools, and alerting systems.
            Unfortunately, poor specificity leads clinicians to be overwhelmed by PDDI information that is “difficult to retrieve, sort and
            digest into clinical decision making” (Bottiger et al. 2009). PDDI alerts are often  criticized for “over-alerting” that
            obfuscates the most important information, hinders the usability of the decision support system, and leads to alert fatigue
            and clinician dissatisfaction (Böttiger, Ylva, et al. 2009; Payne et al. 2015). Moreover, while many compilations of
            PDDI evidence exist to help improve prescriber and pharmacist knowledge, they are not concordant in their coverage,
            accuracy, and agreement (Wang et al. 2010; Saverno et al. 2011; Ayvaz et al. 2015; Fung et al. 2017). Together, these
            shortcomings suggest the need for harmonized approaches for documenting and sharing PDDI information.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>Need, envisioned workflow, and high-level requirements</h2>
            <p>New information regarding PDDIs is published every day in primary sources such as drug product labeling and the scientific
                literature. A PubMed search for publications indexed with the Medical Subject Headings keyword “Drug interactions” shows an
                average of 3,970 publications per year from 2000 through 2016. This suggests that the body of evidence about PDDIs is
                overwhelming and dynamic. Food and drug regulatory agencies in the United States, European Union, and Japan have issued
                guidance to industry recommending the use of drug product labeling to communicate potential involvements in drug
                interactions (Rekić et al. 2017). As it is impossible for clinicians to keep up with the PDDI evidence base, drug
                experts generate summaries of PDDI evidence from primary sources. These summaries bring PDDI knowledge to clinicians
                in the form of published drug information compendia, clinical decision support rules, and interaction checking applications.
                <strong>However, there are currently no broadly accepted standards to guide these experts in the organization and presentation of PDDI
                    information that would be most effective for clinical decision support.</strong></p>

            <p><em>Figure 1</em> PDDI-MI-APPLICATIONS provides an overview of the role envisioned for a PDDI minimal information model.
                Drug experts would generate summaries of PDDI evidence from primary sources using the information elements from the
                PDDI minimal information model. The information elements would cover the minimum set of information required for the
                effective clinical management of PDDI exposure. The resulting common representation of PDDI summaries would facilitate
                curation and information exchange. Downstream applications would process these representations into forms amenable for
                clinical decision support, drug product label enhancement, cohort identification, and other pharmacovigilance activities.</p>

            <p>To achieve these goals, the minimal information model must be flexible and computable. Representations in commonly-used
                formats (JSON,XML/RDF ,etc.) will support ease of construction and parsing of models, particularly through shared libraries
                and APIs. Where possible, model elements should draw upon accepted biomedical taxonomies and ontologies to represent medications,
                diagnoses, and descriptions of potential adverse reactions.  Preferring the use of ontologies over free-text descriptions will
                reduce ambiguity associated with free-text, thus supporting comparison and computational analyses.</p>

            <h2>Core PDDI information events</h2>
            <p>
                This need for a standard representation of PDDI information was one of the topics addressed at two multi-stakeholder
                conference meetings/series (Hines et al. 2011; Scheife et al. 2015; Payne et al. 2015; Tilson et al. 2016). Attendees
                at both conferences included stakeholders from drug information content providers, regulatory agencies, and academic
                organizations. Among the key recommendations was the following suggested set of core information that should be included
                for every PDDI mentioned in a clinically-oriented drug information resource (Payne et al. 2015):
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drugs Involved</li>
                <li>Clinical consequences</li>
                <li>Frequency of exposure to the PDDI</li>
                <li>Frequency of harm for person exposed to PDDI</li>
                <li>Contextual information/modifying factors</li>
                <li>Evidence</li>
                <li>Mechanism of the Interaction</li>
                <li>Recommended Actions</li>
                <li>Seriousness Rating</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                These core information elements are consistent with the results of a separate international Delphi study on how
                to improve the delivery of medication alerts within computerized physician order entry systems (Riedmann et al. 2011).
                This suggested list of core information elements includes some that are present in one or more of the 15 PDDI conceptual
                models analyzed in a recent comprehensive review by Herrero-Zazo, Segura-Bedmar, and Martínez (Herrero-Zazo et al. 2016).
                However, there is little commonality across the conceptual models on those elements that are included and no single
                conceptual model covers all 9 of the information elements. For example, the mechanism of the interaction and clinical
                consequences were present in multiple models but at different levels of granularity. Other information elements, such
                as frequency of exposure and frequency of harm are not present in any of the 15 sources. Even PDDI knowledge bases that
                are strongly clinically-oriented (as opposed to  knowledge bases oriented toward use in bioinformatics or drug development)
                use considerably different information elements. For example, the National Drug File - Reference Terminology (NDF-RT)
                produced by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (Olvey et al. 2010) includes detailed information about pharmacokinetic
                mechanisms but does not discuss clinical consequences. In contrast, the system reported by Mille, Degoulet, and Jaulent
                (Mille  et al. 2007) provided details on the clinical consequences, including risk increasing and mitigating factors,
                but supplied only a limited structure for mechanism.

            <h2>Goals for the minimum information model</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to define a minimum information model for representing and sharing PDDI information and evidence as
                information artifacts. This minimum information model will contribute to medication safety by:

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide a technical foundation that will facilitate broader adoption of recommendations on the core
                    information elements needed for effective PDDI clinical decision support; and</li>
                <li>Highlighting gaps in evidence for developing PDDI decision support.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                These two potential contributions are discussed further in the next two sections.

                <h2>A technical foundation for broader adoption of the core PDDI information elements needed for effective
                PDDI clinical decision support</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, existing drug information sources systems generally organize information into a more or
                    less narrative format includes only some of the core PDDI information elements. To illustrate, consider
                    the PDDI between oral anticoagulants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reported in the
                    well-curated French Interactions médicamenteuses PDDI dataset (ANSM 2016) shown in <em>Figure 2</em> NSAIDExample.
                </p>
                <figure id="NSAID-Example">
                    <img src="W3C-Images/NSAID-Example.png">
                    <figcaption><strong>NSAID-Example</strong> PDDI example from a French compendium</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The PDDI narrative shown in the table is structured into short and easy-to-read description and management
                    sections. However, much of the information in the proposed minimum information model is either not structured
                    or not provided:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Drugs Involved</em> - textual, non-standardized, non-coded lists of ingredients that have been
                        classified as either NSAIDs or as oral anticoagulants</li>
                    <li><em>Clinical consequences</em> - textual, non-standardized, non-coded mention of “hemorrhage” </li>
                    <li><em>Frequency of exposure to the PDDI</em> - no mention </li>
                    <li><em>Frequency of harm for persons who have been exposed to the PDDI</em> - no mention</li>
                    <li><em>Contextual information/modifying factors</em> - no mention</li>
                    <li><em>Evidence</em> - no mention</li>
                    <li><em>Mechanism of the interaction</em> - textual, non-standardized, mention of gastroduodenal irritation by the NSAID</li>
                    <li><em>Recommended actions</em> - avoidance if possible, monitoring otherwise</li>
                    <li><em>Seriousness rating</em> - not explicit. However, the statement “not recommended” would suggest a risk of clinically significant consequence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As is evident from the listing above, there are four minimum information items that are not provided in the
                    narrative (contextual information, frequency of exposure, frequency of harm, and evidence). Contextual information
                    would include drug and patient characteristics factors that might increase or mitigate the risk of harm from exposure
                    to the interaction drug pair. Such information often complements, and sometimes is based on , information on the
                    frequency information items (frequency of exposure to the PDDI and frequency of harm for exposed persons who have
                    been exposed). Together, these information items help to inform the clinician about the risk-benefit tradeoff of PDDI
                    exposure. In fact, it has been shown that effective clinical decision support that improves patient outcomes can be
                    built using such information. For example, Tamblyn et al. found that a novel medication clinical decision support system
                    that provided patient-specific risk estimates of injury due to falls reduced fall-related injury by 1.7 injuries per 1000
                    patients (95% CI 0.2/1000 to 3.2/1000 p=0.02) (Tamblyn et al. 2012). Conversely, when a PDDI summary provides no context
                    about risk and and no frequency information, only clinical decision support alerts based on  simple exposure to the drug
                    combination can be built. This leads to highly sensitive but unspecific alerts and is a primary cause of alert fatigue and
                    clinician dissatisfaction  (van der Sijs et al. 2006).

                <p>
                    Further, the PDDI narrative in Table NSAIDExample provides information without citing supporting evidence.
                    Attendees of the 2015 conference series concluded that “providing access to the evidence is a critical component
                    of weighing the risks and benefits of co-prescribing drugs that have the potential to result in a drug-drug interaction”
                    (Tilson et al. 2016). Evidence in supporting PDDIs includes physiological and pharmacological observations from
                    clinical studies; mechanistic knowledge derived from pre-clinical and clinical studies; and observational data
                    including case reports and various non-randomized studies (Utecht et al 2017, Brochhausen et al. 2014). Evidence
                    may be useful for establishing the existence of an interaction without providing information about the potential
                    clinical effect. Other evidence can help to answer questions about the associated clinical effects and their magnitude,
                    variability, and estimated frequency (Scheife et al. 2015). A PDDI representation should cite specific supporting
                    evidence items and provide some acceptable appraisal of the total body of evidence (Tilson et al. 2016).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unstructured narratives may also fail to provide critical information in computable form suitable for creation
                    of personalized decision support presentation. The interaction described above notes that the mechanism of the
                    interaction involves gastroduodenal irritation by the NSAID, suggesting gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a possible
                    consequence. Such an occurrence would seem unlikely to occur for NSAIDs administered topically rather than orally.
                    However, this constraint on the applicability of this PDDI is not stated implicitly: the formulation of the NSAID
                    being described is ambiguous, and the importance of the means of administration is implied, but not stated directly.
                    Describing PDDI evidence in terms of drugs in established drug terminologies, such as RxNorm
                    (<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/</a>), will reduce ambiguity and enable computation through rules
                    and inference used to turn the PDDI descriptions into actionable content for clinical decision support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The elements of the minimum information model demonstrate that, despite the readability of the example
                    PDDI narrative, the information provided lacks both the structure and semantics necessary for effective
                    decision support. Problems like these are not unique to the French Interactions médicamenteuses.
                    For example, a search for the same Oral Anticoagulant / NSAID interaction executed at the drug
                    ingredient level in the freely accessible database  DrugBank returns a single statement that vaguely
                    describes the clinical effect but with no other information from the core items mentioned above:
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center">“Ibuprofen may increase the anticoagulant activities of Warfarin.”</p>
                <p>
                    As <em>Figure 3</em> shows, slightly more information is provided in United States drug product labeling than
                    in DrugBank but there are still many information gaps relative to the core PDDI information items suggested
                    by conference series attendees (Bristol-Myers Squibb 2017).

                <p>
                    Although missing information is the primary concern for the examples discussed, the minimum information
                    model would also increase the utility of narratives that are abundant with information. For example, a
                    search for oral anticoagulant / NSAID in the online interaction checking tool provided by Drugs.com returns
                    a very detailed narrative that includes mention of clinical effect, mechanism, management options, some
                    contextualized risk information, and specific citations of evidence (Drugs.com search 3/31/17). In this
                    case, the minimum information model would be useful for suggesting how to provide structure and semantics
                    to the description to best enable clinical decision support systems through the use of coded drugs names,
                    clinical consequences, and contextual information and modifying factors.  The provision of these details
                    in a standardized, computable form will facilitate integration of PDDI information with data in a patient's
                    electronic health record, thus enabling patient-specific alerting and decision support.

                <h2>Highlighting gaps in evidence for developing PDDI decision support</h2>
                <p>
                    Existing PDDI knowledge  is heterogeneous with respect to coverage of the core information elements.
                    While the oral anticoagulant / NSAID PDDI used as an example in the above discussion is well known,
                    with information readily available across several core categories, this is rarely the case. Fortunately,
                    new sources of data are becoming available that can be leveraged to generate clinical evidence to rapidly
                    fill knowledge gaps. These include deeply interlinked longitudinal health-care datasets useful for studying
                    real-world PDDI exposure frequency, risk modifying factors, and associations with clinical outcomes
                    (Hennessy et al. 2016).  Additional non-clinical data sources, including web search log data, text mining
                    of social media, and wearable real-time monitoring activities logs, can also be useful (Beninger 2016;
                    Freifeld et al. 2017; Koutkias et al. 2016; Shang et al. 2014; Cameron et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2015;
                    Harpaz et al. 2016). Large research networks have emerged that bridge multiple health systems and registries
                    to enable innovative approaches to generating evidence to inform clinically actionable knowledge. Projects
                    like the All of Us Research Program (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the Million Veteran Program (Gaziano et
                    al. 2016) are seeking to gather health data from more than one million people for the purpose of accelerating
                    research and improve health. These novel programs link whole genome sequencing with health encounter and
                    participant-provided data collected for cohorts of over a million people. Moreover, researchers will be able
                    to prospectively re-contact participants to complete questionnaires and other research procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The developments mentioned above create potential to help advance PDDI decision support. However,
                    the potential can only be realized if gaps in clinically useful PDDI knowledge are identified, prioritized,
                    and addressed using the most appropriate data and methods for evidence generation. One way the minimum
                    information model helps to identify knowledge gaps is that it can act as an information template for a
                    group of drug experts to use while synthesizing evidence for PDDIs. As the expert panel compiles evidence
                    for each of the core information categories, critical gaps in knowledge would become apparent.
                    The prioritized gaps could help clinical research community to make efforts to generate appropriate
                    evidence to fill those gaps.

            <h2>Example Applications of the Minimal Information Model</h2>
            <p>Three examples illustrate possible applications of the minimal information model: HL7 FHIR to support
                SMART on FHIR clinical decision support,  structured product labeling drug-drug interaction section
                indexing, and JSON/JSON-LD cohort descriptions.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Demonstration Example 1: HL7 FHIR to support SMART on FHIR Clinical Decision Support</h2>
                <p>As a standard framework created by HL7, FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) provides
                    a possible solution to the challenge of seamless information exchange and data interoperability of
                    information resources in health care related environments (Bender and Sartipi 2013; Mandel et al. 2016).
                    FHIR offers a solid foundation to overcome some of the data exchange challenges by providing a collection
                    of precise and easily understood specifications for resources in healthcare settings. FHIR defines a set
                    of concise data models for health care resources covering key areas including  Clinical information,
                    Diagnostics and Medications. For instance, the Medication resource contains medication codes, ingredient
                    details, packaging information and related information.</p>
                <p>FHIR encodings of PDDI information could form the basis of information exchange for more standardized
                    clinical decision support.  Although FHIR currently does not have defined a specific resource for drug-drug
                    interactions, the FHIR working group has begun work on a Resource description for adverse events
                    (<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Adverse_Event_Resource">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Adverse_Event_Resource</a>).
                    The Clinical Reasoning resource
                    (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/clinicalreasoning-module.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/clinicalreasoning-module.html</a>)
                    is designed to represent and share knowledge
                    artifacts such including knowledge from research literature, as well as decision rules. Extensions to these
                    and possibly additional new resources could be defined to represent all of the nine types of information in
                    the proposed PDDI minimal information model.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Demonstration example 2 : Structured Product Labeling Drug-drug Interaction Section indexing</h2>
                <p>
                    If a drug’s product labeling is missing information about known drug interactions it might have serious
                    consequences for patients. To address this potential risk, the FDA mandated in 2006 that all product
                    labels for FDA-approved prescription drugs include clinically significant interactions (c.f., CFR 21 201.57(c)(8)),
                    as well as the results of pharmacokinetic studies that establish the absence of effect (c.f., CFR 21 201.57(c)(13)(C))
                    (Code of Federal Regulations Title 21). Structured Product Labels (SPLs) are XML documents written in an HL7 standard
                    that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires industry to use when submitting drug product label
                    content (FDA 2005). The SPLs for all drug products marketed in the United States are available for download from the
                    National Library of Medicine's DailyMed resource (National Library of Medicine 2017). At the time of  this writing,
                    DailyMed provides access to drug product labeling for more than 33,000 prescription products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As was shown in a previous section (see <a href="#tech-foundation">A technical foundation for broader adoption of the core
                    PDDI information elements needed for effective PDDI clinical decision support</a> ), drug product labeling
                    can contain many gaps in information relative to the core PDDI information. Other prior work has shown
                    that many known PDDIs are not mentioned in SPLs (Boyce et al. 2013). This is not a problem is not unique
                    to United States labeling. For instance, Pfistermeister et al. reported that critical drug–drug interaction
                    warnings are frequently missing, or are mentioned inconsistently in the United States, United Kingdom, and
                    German labels of the involved drugs (Pfistermeister et al. 2014).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Task Force force plans to represent PDDIs for which decision trees have been created as
                    supplemental indexing data to the SPLs for the drugs involved. Supplemental indexing to SPLs
                    are SPL files that provide additional useful information for official FDA drug SPLs. Currently,
                    supplemental indexing is used to specify pharmacologic classes, billing units, warning letter alerts,
                    and other information (National Library of Medicine 2017). While a given supplemental indexing file is
                    written in the same SPL document standard, it can include a detailed sub-model like the one planned for
                    the PDDI minimum information model. A feature of the indexing files is that they can be used to both store
                    the supplemental data in a computable format and, using through the use of XSL and XSLT, render the data in
                    various formats including HTML, and PDF, and character-delimited tables. The PDDIs supplemental indexing files
                    will show a technical solution to enhancing SPL drug interaction content with information that could be used for
                    decision support by SPL consumers.

                <h2>Demonstration example 3 : Computable cohort descriptions</h2>
                <p>
                    A prior section discussed that the minimum information model could help highlight research gaps
                    that need to be filled to advance effective PDDI decision support (see <!--TODO needs reference to section--> <a href="">The minimum information model will
                    help highlight research gaps that need to be filled to advance effective PDDI decision support</a>). A powerful
                    method to accomplish this would be through the use of computable cohort descriptions — serialized queries
                    that combine concept sets with logical operations to extract specific patient sub-populations from a clinical
                    data repository. Computable cohort descriptions are a cornerstone for research on PDDIs using real world data.
                    Clinical researcher can use the descriptions to investigate the frequency of exposure to the PDDIs, frequency
                    of clinical outcomes in exposed patients, and factors that modify the risk of harm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Task Force force will show how a JSON representation of PDDIs constructed using the minimum information
                    model and the Task Force force’s decision trees can be translated to computable cohort definitions. The target
                    for translation will be the Atlas clinical research tool created by the Observational Data Health and Informatics
                    collaborative. Atlas has a powerful interface for creating, running, and sharing cohort descriptions
                    (OHDSI 2017; OHDSI 2016). Once created, cohort descriptions can be executed over any clinical dataset that is
                    stored in the OHDSI common data model. For the given project, this would be especially useful for acquiring data
                    from multiple sites on the frequency of exposure to PDDIs and frequency of harm for those exposed.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            The results provide a strong basis for proceeding with the remaining design and implementation activities for the PDDI
            minimum information model. The user stories (see Appendix FINALSTORIES) and information needs (see Appendix USERINFORMATION)
            that the Task Force identified will guide the scope and implementation of the four artifacts that the Task Force will create
            to demonstrate the minimum information model. A large set of information needs were derived from the use cases and user stories.
            Being a minimum information model, the tasks force’s goal will not be to cover all information needs. For example, some needs,
            such as patient lab results and clinician knowledge, are highly context dependent. However, the model should make it clear which
            specific local information (such as a patient lab value) would influence whether to trigger a PDDI alert. This is important so
            that implementers can easily adapt PDDI clinical decision support to the local environment.</p>
            <p>More than a dozen PDDIs are now represented using detailed decision trees. The Task Force will represent all of
            these decision trees using the minimum information model. Three medication reconciliation use cases (see Appendix MEDREC)
            include mention of PDDIs for which the Task Force has developed decision trees. Combined, these artifacts provide a concrete
            focal point that will be useful for demonstrating how serializations of PDDIs written in the PDDI minimum information data
            model will support a clinically important task. While the specific demonstration cases will be described in an interest
                group note that follows this one, we can provide an overview here.

            <h2>Appendix Development Process</h2>
            <p>Toward the goal of developing such a model, a volunteer-based Task Force force was formed by the Health
                Care and Life Sciences Interest Group, an interest group that operates publicly through the World Wide
                Web Consortium (W3C).  This Task Force force has taken a user-centered design approach to designing the
                minimal information model through three main activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A sub-team of drug experts on the Task Force force selected more than a dozen PDDIs to represent
                    using the new information model.</li>
                <li>In parallel, Task Force members initiated an iterative process that involved stakeholders
                    (i.e., individuals who edit drug information sources, various types of clinicians, and decision
                    support systemCDS developers), in the creation of user stories and use cases that define the
                    requirements for the minimum information model.</li>
                <li>Also in parallel, a sub-team of knowledge representation experts developed guidelines for the
                    information model’s semantics of the information model. </li>
            </ul>
            <section>
                <h2>Selecting PDDIs to implement using the minimum information model</h2>
                <p>Prior work by some members of the Task Force force has sought to develop evidence-based clinical
                    algorithms that consider a patient’s electronic health record information to provide a clinician
                    with actionable information tailored to the patient’s specific context. <sup>1</sup>The algorithms are formulated
                    as decision trees to provide concise information including the interaction description, the purported
                    mechanism and possible effects, the evidence supporting the mechanism and effects along with citations
                    listed in the footnotes. Two sample decision trees illustrating the management options can be found in
                    the appendix (see Appendix <a href="#decision-trees">DECISION TREES</a>).</p>
                <blockquote style="font-size: small"><sup>1</sup>The initial decision trees were developed through the “Individualized Drug Interaction Alerts”

                    Title: Individualized Drug Interaction Alerts; Authors: Daniel C. Malone, University of Arizona; John Horn,
                    Philip Hansten, University of Washington).</blockquote>
                <p>The Task Force force built on this prior work by selecting PDDIs to demonstrate the new minimum
                    information model and then creating decision trees for each of the PDDIs that they selected.
                    Task Force drug experts selected the PDDIs and identified contextual information/modifying factors that
                    would warrant any of three different recommended actions - <em>No special precautions, Assess risk and take action
                    if necessary, and Use only if benefit outweighs risk</em>. Draft decision trees were presented during sub-team
                    monthly meetings for thorough discussion. Revisions were made iteratively until the group reached consensus
                    on the presented drafts and finalized the decision trees.</p>
                <p>
                    The Task Force began with a discussion of how to select the PDDIs for developing decision trees.
                    One option was to select the most serious PDDIs. However, it was noted that the seriousness of a PDDI
                    depends a great deal on the patient characteristics context. This meant that it would be difficult to
                    identify PDDIs that were considered the most serious in all clinical settings and for all patients. An
                    alternative approach was to choose PDDIs that would allow the Task Force force to demonstrate how the
                    information model should be used when facing known issues with PDDI evidence and knowledge. Toward that
                    aim, participants were requested to provide suggestions of PDDIs meeting at least one or more of the
                    following criteria which follow from the aforementioned information categories suggested by attendees
                    of the multi-stakeholder conference meetings/series mentioned in section “Model Overview”:

                <h2>Workflow for arriving at stories and goals</h2>
                <p>
                    User stories and goals were developed in order to showcase how the PDDI minimum information model
                    will support users. The Task Force force began developing the Stakeholder Description document and
                    the PDDI Minimum Information Model User Scenarios document in order to identify key users. These
                    stakeholder descriptions and user scenarios were used as the basis for further brainstorming with
                    the assistance of a user experience expert to develop a master list of tasks, users, information needs,
                    information values, and barriers to drug-drug interaction based decision-making in a variety of situations.
                    A core set of user types was selected for development of user stories based on the scope of the minimum
                    information model. These will be presented in the Results section. UThe user types considered “out of scope”
                    are listed in Appendix <a href="#out-of-scope-stories">OUTOFSCOPESTORIES</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to develop the user stories for the core user types, Task Force force members created an
                    initial information needs list  and then was supplemented it with user interviews, interview transcripts
                    collected as a part of a recently published manuscript on PDDI information needs of drug information
                    compendia editors (Romagnoli et al. 2017), and the published literature. Where possible, user stories
                    were based on PDDIs suggested by the Task Force force’s PDDI experts. All user stories were reviewed
                    during team meetings to solicit feedback and comments. Based on Task Force force member suggestions,
                    the user stories were edited to make them more clinically relevant, accurate and appropriate. Information
                    model items were highlighted based on a color-coded key to indicate the the minimum information model
                    information item in question.

                <h2>A set of use cases focused on medication reconciliation</h2>
                <p>
                    Medication reconciliation use cases were recommended by a Task Force force members as a way to highlight
                    the Task Force force information model elements. To obtain background information for the medication
                    reconciliation use cases, a third year PharmD student conducted structured interviews with a hospital
                    pharmacist and with a consultant pharmacist andalong with an observedation of the hospital pharmacist
                    medication reconciliation process. Detailed use cases were drafted based on points raised during the
                    interviews and drug-drug interactions highlighted by the interviewed pharmacists. Where possible, the
                    Task Force force’s selected PDDIs were incorporated. Draft use cases were sent to the interviewed
                    pharmacists for feedback and edits, and then presented during a full Task Force force meeting involving
                    all participants. Suggestions from this meeting were incorporated into the use cases. As with the user
                    stories mentioned above, in order to tie the medication reconciliation use cases more closely to
                    user-centered definitions, information model items were highlighted based on a color-coded key to
                    indicate the user-centered definition in question. The modified use cases were then sent to members
                    of the Task Force force using a questionnaire custom built using Qualtrics software
                    (<a href="www.qualtrics.com">www.qualtrics.com</a>).
                    This approach was chosen to allow for additional, anonymous feedback.

                <h2>Workflow for arriving at user-centered definitions</h2>
                <p>
                    We used the process shown in <em>Figure 4</em> to arrive at user-centered definitions for
                    the core information items recommended by the prior drug interaction conference series
                    (see section “Model Overview”). We started with an initial definition of each item based on
                    suggestions by members of the Task Force force and review of the DINTO (Herrero-Zazo et al. 2015)
                    and DIDEO (Brochhausen et al. 2014) ontologies. We then solicited feedback from all Task Force
                    force participants using a Qualtrics survey (see  Appendix SURVEY ). The survey asked participants
                    to rate their level of agreement with the definition and the evidence presented using a Likert
                    scale (Strongly agree, Agree, Somewhat agree, Neither agree nor disagree, Somewhat disagree,
                    Disagree, Strongly disagree), followed by questions about how to modify the definition in order
                    to make it more general or specific. Feedback was collected and synthesized, and then the proposed
                    definition was modified based on Task Force force recommendations. The Task Force force sub-teams
                    discussed and developed final versions. The definitions were finalized for use in the PDDI minimum
                    information model.

                <h2>Setting the scope for knowledge representation</h2>
                <p>
                    The Task Force force recognized that the wide range of potential use cases for the information model
                    require flexibility in certain aspects of the knowledge representation. The number of pre-existing
                    ontologies relevant to theis PDDI domain of discourse clearly demonstrates that richness of the domain.
                    To keep the minimum information model lean and to ensure its maintainability and usability, it was
                    necessary to develop a clear scope for the knowledge representation including issues such as:
                </p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Does the scope of knowledge representation include Do we provide only the terms identified
                        through the Task Force force or does it also include we aim to model terms relevant to those terms?</li>
                    <li>What is the relation to previously developed other, pre-existing ontologies?</li>
                    <li>Will we reuse of terms from other resources such as drug and disease terminologies be allowed?</li>

                        across biomedicine (e.g., continuants, occurrents, information artifacts, etc.)?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The answers to these questions were determined through a series of teleconferences bringing together domain
                    experts, biomedical informatics specialists, and knowledge representation experts across the Task Force force.
                    The topics were discussed, arguments for different approaches were laid out and, agreement among the participants
                    was sought. In addition to the conversation during the teleconferences, participants had the opportunity to add
                    comments and voice their opinion to the statements in the document. When the Task Force force arrived at a
                    consolidated version, the group voted by teleconference and through e-mail. The result of that vote is to be
                    regarded the final version of the document and is provided in the results section.

                    Three detailed medication reconciliation use cases were created by the Task Force force to
                    demonstrate the information needed in a clinical workflow. One use case is for a Hospital Pharmacist
                    dealing with medication reconciliation upon admission., Another case was for a hospital pharmacist
                    completing a dealing with medication reconciliation upon discharge., and a A third for a consultant
                    pharmacist performing medication reconciliation upon patient readmission. All three use cases include
                    mention of PDDIs for which the Task Force force has developed decision trees. The three use cases are

                    <p>
                        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antiplatelet effects which
                        increase the bleeding risk when combined with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin.
                        The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the
                        circulation, unlike aspirin’s antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks
                        after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the
                        evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper
                        gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

                    <span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">85-year-old male
                        dementia patient</span> who was transferred from a skilled nursing

                    vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) infection.
                    At the nursing home, Bill was prescribed sertraline to treat
                    depression.  Beth receives an alert that linezolid, which is being
                    considered to treat the VRE infection, has a potential interaction
                    with the sertraline that Bill is currently taking.  <span style="background-color: #a9d098">Linezolid is a
                        weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor</span>, and has been shown to

                    continuing the sertraline and adding on the linezolid, the
                    <span style="background-color: #f6bf8b">potential

                    management options, such as selecting an alternative medication or

                    increased risk of serotonin syndrome.  In order to gather this
                    information, she reviews Bill’s history, lab results, and allergies
                    from the health records faxed by his skilled nursing facility, as
                    well as his medication list upon admission.  She reviews LexicompTM
                    and the hospital’s intranet resources for additional information,
                    but is having trouble finding information that is relevant to Bill’s

                    Beth is reviewing the physician’s discharge order for Maria.

                    While reviewing Maria’s medications,
                    Beth sees that Maria is being discharged with spironolactone, a
                    potassium-sparing diuretic that could potentially interact with the
                    potassium chloride that Maria had been taking to treat low potassium
                    levels.  Spironolactone <span style="background-color: #a9d098">may increase potassium levels in Maria’s blood,
                    leading to hyperkalemia</span>.  Beth reviews Maria’s electronic health record
                    in order to view her lab results and her other medications.  She sees
                    that Maria is also

                    and since ACE inhibitors can also increase potassium levels, Beth would

                    has increased Maria’s <span style="background-color: #fee087">risk of

                    spironolactone.  Beth would like to know how likely it is that Maria
                    will experience hyperkalemia, <span style="background-color: #f6bf8b">how serious hyperkalemia may be</span>, and
                    <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">how to manage the interaction, such as by discontinuing one of Maria’s

                    MicromedexTM, for recommendations.  She would also like more
                    information about the potassium chloride that Maria was taking
                    as one of her home medications, so she will need to contact
                    Maria’s community pharmacy in order to find out the strength
                    of the medication and if the prescription was still current.

                    <li>The mechanism is known and is pharmacokinetic:  Warfarin + 2C9 inhibitors (metronidazole)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Patrick is a nursing home consultant pharmacist who is reviewing the
                    medications of a readmitted patient, Nancy.  Nancy is a
                    <span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">78 year-old
                    woman</span> who is being transferred back to her skilled nursing facility
                    after a hospital admission for a Clostridium difficile (C. diff)
                    infection; prior to the hospital admission, she was prescribed
                    warfarin at the skilled nursing facility for <span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">deep vein thrombosis
                    (DVT) treatment</span>.  Based on the hospital discharge summary, it
                    appears that Nancy was taken off of the warfarin at the hospital
                    due to an increased INR, and returned to the skilled nursing
                    facility without an order for warfarin.  Patrick sees that a
                    potential interaction may occur with the warfarin that Nancy
                    had been prescribed prior to her hospitalization, and the
                    metronidazole now used to treat her infection, since
                    <span style="background-color: #a9d098">metronidazole is a CYP2C9 inhibitor and may increase the
                        plasma concentration of warfarin</span>.  A clinical consequence of
                    this interaction would be an
                    <span style="background-color: #fee087">increased INR leading to an increased
                    risk of bleeding</span>.  Patrick would like to gather
                    <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">management
                    recommendations</span> for this interaction prior to contacting Nancy’s
                    physician.  He is interested in Nancy’s duration of therapy for

                    for a DVT, and if she is indicated for prophylactic therapy.
                    Patrick also wants to know <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">if and when warfarin should be restarted,
                    and at what dose, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding due to
                    the interaction</span>.  He would also like to know <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">if metronidazole is
                    the best option to continue treating Nancy’s C. diff infection,
                    or if there is an alternative option that may not interact with
                    warfarin</span>.  In order to gather this information, he reviews Nancy’s
                    previous INR values, medication list, and history.  He is also
                    contacting the hospital in order to determine whether warfarin
                    had been given at any point during Nancy’s stay, if the dosage
                    had been adjusted, what other medications she was given, and if
                    any of her other medications were discontinued.  He also reviews
                    his company’s intranet resources for additional information about
                    the interaction and possible <span style="background-color: #dfa99f">evidence-based recommendations</span>.
                    Patrick is also interested in the <span style="background-color: #a8a8a8">frequency of serious bleeding
                    events </span><span style="background-color: #d0c7e3">in geriatric patients co-prescribed warfarin and

                <h2>Example 1: warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</h2>
                    <pre class="example" style="white-space: pre-wrap" title="Warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)">
&ltMPIO:MPIO_0000005 label=’mechanism of interaction information’&gt
    ‘Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antiplatelet effects which increase the bleeding risk when combined with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin. The antiplatelet effect of NSAIDs lasts only as long as the NSAID is present in the circulation, unlike aspirin’s antiplatelet effect, which lasts for up to 2 weeks after aspirin is discontinued. NSAIDs also can cause peptic ulcers and most of the evidence for increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs plus warfarin is due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).’

&lt/MPIO:MPIO_0000003&gt

&ltMPIO:MPIO_0000009 label=’seriousness’&gt
    ‘Bleeding is a serious potential clinical consequence because it can result in death, life-threatening hospitalization, and disability.’
&lt/MPIO:MPIO_0000009&gt

&ltMPIO:MPIO_0000010 label=’severity’&gt
     ‘The intensity of a bleeding event may vary’
&lt/MPIO:MPIO_0000010&gt

&ltMPIO:MPIO_0000008 label=’recommended action’&gt
‘If the NSAID is being used as an analgesic or antipyretic, it would be prudent
to use an alternative such as acetaminophen. In some people, acetaminophen can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, so monitor the INR if acetaminophen is used in doses over 2 g/day for a few days. For more severe pain consider short-term opioids in place of the NSAID.’
